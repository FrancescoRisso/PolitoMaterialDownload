<!--
Settings should be located in the same folder as the code, in a file called `settings.json` with the following format:

```
{
	"polito": {
		"user": <polito email>,
		"pass": <polito password>
	}
}
```

Everything enclosed in `<>` should be replaced with the correct value, enclosed in `""`

-   `<polito email>` is your email from polito (in the format `<sXXXXXX@studenti.polito.it>`)
-   `<polito password>` is the password of your polito account
